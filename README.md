# first_assignment

## Description
This webpage was produced to make the company Horiseon's web page more accesible to the public and to improve search engine optimization. This 
project created semantic HTML elements within the index.html file. This project also consolidated repetitive styling code, fixed faulty links, and added comments. I learned that it is easier to navagate an HTML document that had comments before elements and reading an HTML code using semantic HTML. 


## Usage
You use this web page by navigating the nav bar to be brought to that specific section about Horisean's company offerings.
Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.
